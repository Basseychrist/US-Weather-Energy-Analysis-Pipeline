# AI Assistance in US Weather + Energy Analysis Pipeline

This project was developed with the help of AI-powered coding assistance (GitHub Copilot).  
Below are the main areas where AI contributed to the codebase:

---

## Where AI Helped

- **Code Generation:**  
  AI suggested and generated boilerplate code for data fetching, processing, and analysis modules.

- **Bug Fixes:**  
  AI identified and corrected logic errors, such as temperature conversion issues and missing data handling.


- **Refactoring:**  
  AI suggested improvements for code structure, modularization, and readability.



## How to Use AI Assistance

- Use AI suggestions as a starting point, but always review and test the code.
- AI can help with repetitive tasks, documentation, and code reviews.
- For complex business logic, validate AI-generated code with domain experts.

## Note

All code was reviewed and tested by me before deployment.
